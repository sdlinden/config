# Installation

You can clone the git repo and run the setup.sh

   git clone ${PROJECT}

or

You can download the setup.sh with wget and rune the setup.sh file.

   wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdlinden/config/master/setup.sh
   ./setup.sh

or

You can run the setup.sh directly from githup with curl.

   curl -kL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdlinden/config/master/setup.sh
